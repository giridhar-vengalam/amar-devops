How to provide a sudo access:

/etc/sudoers

Ownership and permissions:

owner: who creates the file.
group: who creates the file other: apart from owner and group all are other users.

-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 584 Dec  4 06:35 ajay

( - ): It is a file type,here the '-' is nothing but file.If you see d in the first field it is directory.

(rw-): These permissions are for owner(root).

(r--): These permissions are for group(root).

(r--): These are for other users.

drwx------. 3 root root  17 Dec  4 16:59 systemd-private-5fd227d8a4ef48e6b5c6882e39a20c34-chronyd.service-BlH8yz

(d): d in the first field ,so it is a directory.

-rw-rw-r--. 1 devops devops   0 Dec  4 17:53 devops



How to change ownerships:

 chown (desired owner) (to which file/directory you would like to change).

How to change the group:

chgrp (desired group) (to which file/directory you would like to change).

How to change permissions:

let
read =4      CHMOD UGO=777
write=2
execute=1

eg:644= rw-r-r--
777=rwx-rwx-rwx-
755=rwx-rx-rx

command:
chmod (desired number) (desird file name to change)
660
-rw-rw----. 1 root root   0 Dec  4 17:53 devops



Package management:

Yum install (package name).

To know how mny files installed:

rpm -qa

java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.232.b09-0.el7_7.x86_64

Service Management:
eg:
 to maintain web server, we need to install httpd

to run the application, we need to start the service by a command

systemctl status (service name)
systemctl start/stop/restart (service name) for doing respetive functions.




Process management:

Process management:
Process: It is nothing but a task or command running in your system.
Process id: Every process will have a unique-id.
How to kill a process?
Kill -9 <process id>
Top command:
Top is one of the important process management tools where I can find process list in CPU and memory utilization order by pressing shift-p and shift-m respectively and also we can see how much total RAM and CPU being utilized.
